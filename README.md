### Notes
- Loadout code is `sst`.
- You can fumble for the stim while incapped if you mash the dedicated key. See the controls.
- Super stims reduce the incap timer, allowing you to get up sooner.
- Having blues doubles the effectiveness of the stim at the cost of some blues and the drugs being absorbed twice as fast.
- All healing effects scale with how much of the drug you have left in your system.
